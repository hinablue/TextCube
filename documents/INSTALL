Textcube Installation
---------------------

Please read manual_requirements.txt to see what softwares you need before installation.

For MySQL 4.1 or above, UTF-8 for default character set and collation settings
is strongly recommended.

1. For Linux Systems:

  Step 1: Make sure the directory of Textcube is accessible from Apache, and
          has write permissions on the main directory and cache, attachment, 
          skin, skin/customize subdirectories.

          If you can't change owner or group of file/directories, you may set
          777 permission on them.

  Step 2: Create apropriate MySQL user/database if you need. Or you may consult
          your web-hosting provider.

  Step 3: Run setup.php on your web browser and follow instructions.

2. For Windows Systems:

  Step 1: Install and setup IIS, PHP, MySQL.

  Step 2: Install a free open-source rewrite filter. It supports IIS5/6/7.

          There is another implementation provided by IIS Development Team, but it has
          encoding problems with non-ASCII URLs and runs only on IIS7.

  Step 3: Grant all permissions on the Textcube directory and its subdirectories to
          IIS_IUSRS group or appropriate user/groups.

  Step 4: Run setup.php on your web browser.

  Step 5: You will see a notice about IIS during installation.

  Step 6: After setup, add $service['fancyURL'] = 2; to config.php to force using rewrites.
          (optional)

  Step 7: Copy all rewrite rules in .htaccess to IsapiRewrite4.ini as instructed.
          setup.php will generate these rules by recognizing the web server.
  
  Step 8: Restart the web server or the application pool if you're using FastCGI.
     
     NOTE: For 64bit IIS 7.0, you have to turn on 32bit compatibility mode in advanced settings
           of the application pool to use this rewrite filter properly.

  TIPS:
   * Change upload_tmp_dir setting in php.ini to avoid permission problems with file uploads.
     You have to grant all permissions on it to IIS_IUSRS group.
   * To apply changes of php.ini when you use FastCGI, refresh your application pool instead
     of restarting the web service.
