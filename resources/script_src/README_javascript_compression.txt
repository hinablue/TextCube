We baked javascript files with 'Packer Javascript (http://joliclic.free.fr/php/javascript-packer/en/index.php)' commpression program to reduce traffic load. 

Original file has '.source' postfix. If you want to change those files, modify original files and rebake them. (or you can just use them without compression)
